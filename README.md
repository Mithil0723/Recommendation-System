Through this recommendation systems project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of core concepts like content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid methods. I implemented practical algorithms such as TF-IDF for feature extraction and matrix factorization using SVD, while also exploring advanced techniques like deep learning for recommendations. The project exposed me to real-world challenges including the cold start problem and scalability issues, as well as the importance of proper evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and RMSE. I learned to use popular libraries such as Surprise and TensorFlow, and gained valuable experience in building end-to-end recommendation systems. Importantly, I also considered ethical implications, understanding the potential for bias in these systems. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also sparked my interest in ongoing advancements in the field, preparing me for future data science challenges and inspiring continued learning in this rapidly evolving area.
